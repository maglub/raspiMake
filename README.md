# Introduction

This Makefile will help you create raspbian-lite SD cards on Mac OSX. You might get it to work on Linux as well, but I have not put any thought into making it work across the borders. This Makefile supports creating /boot/ssh and /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf automatically, see below.

* jessie - for projects that are not yet ready for the latest and greatest release
* stretch - currently the latest release

Usage:

```
#--- make without any options will list connected SD cards (and other disks)
make 
#--- create a card with raspbian-jessie-lite
make jessie DISK=X

#--- create a card with raspbian-stretch-lite
make stretch DISK=X
```

make will download and unpack the necessary image, and write it to the selected /dev/rdisk device.

## Pre requisites

* pv

```
brew install pv
```

If you don't feel like installing the "pv" command, just replace "pv" with "cat" in the Makefile.

# Examples

I recommend that you create both a ./wpa_supplicant.conf file and a ./ssh file, so that you start your raspberry pi with a working wifi connection and ssh enabled. This, of course, have some security implications. Don't leave your raspberry pi like that without changing the password for the "pi" user, and do not connect it directly to the internet.

## SSH

If you want ssh to be enabled at boot, touch ./ssh and run make.

Example:

```
touch ./ssh
make stretch DISK=X
```

## wpa_supplicant.conf

If you want your favorite wifi configured, create a wpa_supplicant.conf file in this directory, and it will automatically be copied to the SD card.

```
cat<<EOT > wpa_supplicant.conf
country=GB
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
  ssid="YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
  psk="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_WIFI_PASSWORD"
  id_str="HOME"
  priority=15
}
EOT

make stretch DISK=X
```

## Simple demo

```
$ make
diskutil list
