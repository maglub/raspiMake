# Introduction

This Makefile will help you create raspbian-lite SD cards on Mac OSX. You might get it to work on Linux as well, but I have not put any thought into making it work across the borders.

* jessie - for projects that are not yet ready for the latest and greatest release
* stretch - currently the latest release

Usage:

```
#--- make without any options will list connected SD cards (and other disks)
make 
#--- create a card with raspbian-jessie-lite
make jessie DISK=X

#--- create a card with raspbian-stretch-lite
make stretch DISK=X
```

make will download and unpack the necessary image, and write it to the selected /dev/rdisk device.

## SSH

If you want ssh to be enabled at boot, touch ./ssh and run make.

Example:

```
touch ./ssh
make stretch DISK=X
```

## wpa_supplicant.conf

If you want your favorite wifi configured, create a wpa_supplicant.conf file in this directory, and it will automatically be copied to the SD card.

```
cat<<EOT > wpa_supplicant.conf
country=GB
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
  ssid="YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
  psk="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_WIFI_PASSWORD"
  id_str="HOME"
  priority=15
}
EOT

make stretch DISK=X
```
